# Day 7 – APIRouter & Project Structure (Job Tracker API)

## Why project structure matters
Real backend applications grow quickly.
Keeping all routes in one file becomes unmanageable.

## What is APIRouter?
APIRouter helps split APIs by feature.
Each router handles a specific responsibility.

## Project idea: Job Application Tracker
This API tracks job applications and user profile information.

This shows that backend concepts can be reused across domains.

## Benefits of this structure
- Cleaner code
- Easy to scale
- Easier for teams to collaborate
- Industry-standard FastAPI practice

## What I learned today
- How to organize routes using APIRouter
- How to structure a real backend project
- How to apply backend concepts to different domains
