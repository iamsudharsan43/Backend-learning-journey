# Day 16 – SQL Basics

## What is a database?
A database stores data permanently.
Unlike lists or dictionaries, data remains even after the app restarts.

## What is SQL?
SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to:
- Create tables
- Insert data
- Read data
- Update data
- Delete data

## Why backend developers must know SQL
- APIs depend on databases
- Performance depends on queries
- Almost all backend jobs require SQL

## Core SQL commands (CRITICAL)

### CREATE TABLE
Used to define structure of data.

### INSERT
Used to add new records.

### SELECT
Used to read data from tables.

### UPDATE
Used to modify existing records.

### DELETE
Used to remove records.

## Tables & rows
- Table → like a spreadsheet
- Row → one record
- Column → one field

## Primary Key
- Uniquely identifies each row
- Usually an ID

## What I learned today
